The XDAM front-end features a large number of options for setup along with external projects and APIs, or for using it with its back-end and different data models.

For all these tasks this software provides some configurations files (Some of them only available before webpack) that allows to adapt the functionality to our needs.

## Profiles

Short  json configuration files that allows us to change the default component order, behaviour or hide undesired buttons or options.

## Themes

CSS style sheets that only change colors or basic appearances for HTML elements and can be easily modified before webpack. 

## Environment

Window-attached json with all the environment variables needed for use with any api or backend, including endpoints, auth token, model-mappers, or blueprints for dynamic post forms.
